<final_deliverable>
After the examination report, provide:

1. **Prioritized action list** — numbered steps to fix the skill, ordered by impact
2. **Revised SKILL.md outline** — an outline describing how to restructure/fix the skill (do not provide a full rewritten SKILL.md file)
3. **Migration notes** — what to do with content being moved/deleted
</final_deliverable>

<empty_section_handling>
If a section has no findings, include it with "None found" rather than omitting it. This satisfies Quality Gate G1 (Coverage).

Example:
```
**CONTRADICTIONS FOUND**

None found.
```
